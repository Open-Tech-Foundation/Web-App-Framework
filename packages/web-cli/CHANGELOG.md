# @opentf/web-cli

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `otfw dev` / `otfw build` now compile every module through a single long-lived
  `otfwc serve` process instead of spawning `otfwc build` per file. The toolchain pays
  the compiler-binary startup cost once, which is the dominant dev-server start cost —
  on the docs site the initial bundle drops from ~16.7s to ~3.1s and incremental
  rebuilds to well under a second. The child is `unref`'d (so one-shot builds still
  exit promptly) and torn down on process exit.

## 1.0.0
